# aws-docker
A simple wrapper script to pass AWS CLI commands to a docker image

You must have docker installed.

Once installed, simply call the aws script from the bash command line, as you would with the aws cli itself.

This makes use of the awesome docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/cgswong/aws/
